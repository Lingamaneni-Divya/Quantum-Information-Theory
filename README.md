# Quantum-Information-Theory
This a report on Mathematical formalism used to model Quantum Noise and for understanding the Quantum Measurement Postulate in detail.
The continuation work will be on Quantun Noise and Quantum Error-Correction techniques (https://www.overleaf.com/read/txvpvwkfnfzm) 
will be updated as the project progresses
